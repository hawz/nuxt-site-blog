          <h3>Who am I ü§î</h3>
          <p>
            I am a front end web developer pushing code from Sassari, Italy. I
            have experience in creating interactive websites and multilingual
            applications in English and Italian for over 10 years. I not only
            design but hand code in a number of programming languages. Check out

          <h3>Things I like üòã</h3>
          <p>
            I have a passion for beautiful code, making things work and front
            end development frameworks: I started with AngularJS back in 2014,
            then discovered Angular, and finally switched to (and fell in ‚ù§Ô∏è
            with) Vue.js and React. Plus, I have a passion for Rails, which I
            try to keep up with and I use for some side-project that probably
            will never see the light of day. I like tidiness in all its forms,
            probably due to a little OCD.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love cats, playing basketball, hiking, riding my motorbike and
            mountain bike, reading graphic novels and nordic noirs, eating any
            kind of food (everything but tripe, it's like Kryptonite to me ü§¢),
            traveling to any kind of destination, especially the Nordics.

          <p>
            It's a wonderful island in the Mediterranean, famous for its
            excellent climate and high
